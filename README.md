# SketchNet Classification

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a SketchNet model for image classification. The SketchNet model is based on the ResNet-18 architecture and is trained on a custom dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is organized into two main folders: Train and Validation. The Train folder contains training images along with a corresponding CSV file (`Train.csv`) that specifies the image names and their corresponding labels. The Validation folder contains validation images along with a similar CSV file (`Validation.csv`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/sketchnet-classification.git
2. Change into the project directory: cd sketchnet-classification
## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:
- Extract the training and validation images from their respective archive files (`Train.rar` and `Validation.rar`) located in the `SketchNet_Data` directory.
- Rename the extracted `SketchNet Data` folder to `SketchNet_Data` for consistency.

2. Training:
- Run the code to train the SketchNet model
